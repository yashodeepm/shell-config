#Shell configuration currently used

Currently using Oh-my-zsh with the following plugins: `git`, `zsh-autosuggestions`, `zsh-syntax-highlighting` and `powerlevel10k` theme. The other configured theme here is `cobalt2`.

[Prerequisite here is to install oh-my-zsh]
##Plugins:
Plugins can be configured by installing the plugin to the $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/<plugin_name> folder. Then this can be added to the plugins section of .zshrc.

##Themes:
Themes can be downloaded to $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/<theme-name>.zsh-theme file. The zsh-theme file can be specifically modified to suit your needs.

Specifically for powerlevel10k, you can run `p10k configure`

For installing colorls (the one that beautifies ls output) use `gem install colorls` and add an alias for the same
